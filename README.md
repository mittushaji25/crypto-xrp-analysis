# XRP Crypto Analysis

Welcome to Crypto XRP Analysis - a project aimed at uncovering meaningful insights about the XRP cryptocurrency through data-driven techniques. This repository contains tools and notebooks that help analyze XRP price trends, correlations, and performance using Python.

## Work Completed

### Data Acquisition
- Collected historical XRP-USDT price data from Binance via `ccxt` and `yfinance`.
- Cleaned and formatted time-series data for analysis.

### Feature Engineering
- Generated a comprehensive set of technical indicators:
  - RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Moving Averages
  - Price momentum, volatility, and volume metrics
- Saved feature enginered dataset as: `xrpusdt_features.csv`

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized feature distributions and market behavior.
- Explored volatility patterns and price trends.
- Plotted indicator overlays on candlestick charts.

### Modeling Preparation
- ETL pipeline completed and clean dataset ready for training.
- Target variable setup and label encoding underway.

### Forecasting and Prediction
- Develop predictive models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM)
- Evaluate model performance and metrics (In progress)

## Next Steps
- Build a dashboard for decision support using predictions
